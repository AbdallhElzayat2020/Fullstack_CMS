Hi there,

here is a quick note about lecture  

( Optional ) Role Management - How to Create Roles

( Optional ) Role Management - How to Create Permissions and Assign it

as you can guess by the name of the lecture this two are optional. If you already worked with (Laravel Permission ) package then you don’t have to watch this to lectures. but if you didn’t work with this package before please do watch the lectures it will help you a lot.

Thanks.
